<br>Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed
through some <br>interesting places on the way: 
<ol>
	<li>walla walla WA</li>
	<li>Magic City ID</li>
	<li>Bountiful, UT</li>
	<li>Last Chance, CO,</li>
	<li>Truth or Consequences, NM</li>
	<li>Why, AZ</li>
</ol>

<h3>July 14, 2012</h3>
I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the road today:
<blockquote>Passing cars, <br>When you can't see, <br>May get you, <br>A glimpse, <br>Of eternity.</blockquote>
I definitely won't be passing any cars.

<h3>June 2, 2012</h3>
<img src="images/segway1.jpg"alt="segway1"> <br>My first day of the trip!  I can't believe I finally got everything <br>packed and ready to go.  Because I'm on a Segway,<br>I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me: 
<ul>
	<li>cellphone</li>
    <li>ipod</li>
    <li>digital camera</li>
    <li>and a protein bar</li>
 </ul>
Just the essentials.  As Lao Tzu would have said, <p>"A journey of a thousand miles begins with one Segway."</p>
